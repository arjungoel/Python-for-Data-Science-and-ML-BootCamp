# Methods are essentially just calls you can make off an object that will affect the object or return a result in some manner.
# split() method is useful for the text analysis.
# we can actually pass a string into split() to split individual values or characters.
# keys() method returns all the keys in a dictionary.
# dictionaries don't retain in order.
# list.pop() -> pop() method pops up the list and returns the last element which is to be removed. We can also mention the index of the element we want to pop i.e. pop(index).
# append() -> allows you to append the element at the end of the list.
